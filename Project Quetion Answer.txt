❓ “Explain your fraud detection project”
✅ Best 1–2 minute answer (you can memorize this)

I worked on a credit card fraud detection classification project using a highly imbalanced dataset.
The dataset had around 284,000 transactions, out of which only about 0.17% were frauds.

I performed data cleaning and EDA, confirmed there were no missing values, and analyzed class imbalance.

To handle imbalance, I applied SMOTE on the training data. I then scaled features using StandardScaler to ensure consistency.

I trained a Random Forest classifier, evaluated it using confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC.

The model achieved ROC-AUC of ~0.96, and was able to correctly detect most fraudulent transactions with high recall, which is critical in fraud detection.

2️⃣ Dataset & EDA Questions
❓ “Why is this dataset difficult?”

✅ Answer:

The dataset is extremely imbalanced. Fraud cases are very rare, so a model can achieve high accuracy by predicting everything as non-fraud, which is misleading.

❓ “Why didn’t you rely on accuracy?”

✅ Answer:

Accuracy is not reliable for imbalanced data.
I focused on recall, precision, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, especially recall for fraud class.

3️⃣ Class Imbalance (Very Important 🔥)
❓ “Why did you use SMOTE?”

✅ Answer:

SMOTE generates synthetic samples for the minority class, helping the model learn fraud patterns instead of being biased toward non-fraud transactions.

❓ “Why apply SMOTE only on training data?”

✅ Answer:

Applying SMOTE on test data would cause data leakage.
The test set must represent real-world data.

✔️ This answer is interviewer-impressing

4️⃣ Feature Scaling Questions
❓ “Why did you use StandardScaler?”

✅ Answer:

StandardScaler ensures features are on the same scale, which improves model stability and generalization.
I used fit_transform on training data and transform on test data to avoid data leakage.

❓ “Is scaling needed for Random Forest?”

✅ Smart answer:

Random Forest doesn’t strictly require scaling, but since SMOTE and probability estimation are involved, scaling helps maintain consistency and avoids numerical bias.
Random Forest itself does not require feature scaling because it is based on decision trees.
However, since my pipeline included SMOTE(SMOTE creates synthetic points using distances between samples.), which relies on distance calculations, and probability-based evaluation, scaling was applied to ensure meaningful synthetic samples and consistent model behavior.

5️⃣ Model Selection Questions
❓ “Why Random Forest?”

✅ Answer:

Random Forest handles non-linear relationships well, is robust to noise, and performs well on imbalanced datasets.
It also provides feature importance for interpretability.

❓ “Did you try other models?”

✅ Answer:

This project focused on Random Forest, but Logistic Regression can also be used as a baseline for comparison.

6️⃣ Confusion Matrix (They LOVE This)

Your confusion matrix:

TN = 56,642

FP = 9

FN = 22

TP = 73

❓ “Explain your confusion matrix”

✅ Best explanation:

Out of all transactions:

73 frauds were correctly detected (True Positives)

22 frauds were missed (False Negatives)

Only 9 normal transactions were incorrectly flagged as fraud (False Positives)

Minimizing false negatives is critical in fraud detection because missing fraud is more costly than falsely flagging a transaction.

❓ “Which is more dangerous: FP or FN?”

✅ Answer:

False Negatives are more dangerous because missing a fraud directly causes financial loss.

7️⃣ Classification Report Questions
❓ “Explain precision and recall for fraud class”

✅ Answer:

Precision (0.89) means 89% of transactions predicted as fraud were actually fraud

Recall (0.77) means the model detected 77% of all actual frauds

❓ “Which metric did you prioritize?”

✅ Answer:

Recall for fraud class, because detecting fraud is more important than minimizing false alarms.

8️⃣ ROC-AUC Questions
❓ “What does ROC-AUC = 0.96 mean?”

✅ Best answer:

It means the model has a 96% chance of ranking a random fraud transaction higher than a random non-fraud transaction.

🔥 This line sounds very professional.

9️⃣ Feature Importance Questions
❓ “What did feature importance tell you?”

✅ Answer:

Features like V14, V10, V12, V4, and V17 were the strongest fraud indicators.
This shows the model relies on meaningful transaction patterns rather than noise.

❓ “Can you explain what V14 means?”

✅ Honest answer (acceptable):

The features are PCA-transformed, so their original meaning is hidden for privacy reasons.
However, their importance indicates strong fraud-related patterns.

✔️ Interviewers accept this.

🔟 Real-World & Improvement Questions
❓ “How would you improve this model?”

✅ Answer:

Try threshold tuning to increase recall

Use XGBoost or LightGBM:- in this Trees are built sequentially,Each new tree focuses on previous mistakes,
They handle imbalanced data very well,Often achieve higher recall and ROC-AUC.I would try XGBoost or LightGBM because boosting models correct previous errors and often perform better on imbalanced datasets like fraud or churn.

Monitor precision-recall tradeoff:-
High recall → catch more fraud but more false alarms
High precision → fewer false alarms but miss some fraud
So I would tune the classification threshold and monitor the precision–recall tradeoff to balance fraud detection and false alarms according to business requirements.
for change i can tune the classification threshold and monitor the precision–recall tradeoff to select a balance that aligns with business requirements.

Retrain periodically to handle concept drift:- Your model learned patterns from old data.
Over time: Those patterns become outdated, Model performance drops silently, A fraud pattern from 2023 may not work in 2025.
Since fraud and customer behavior evolve over time, I would periodically retrain the model to handle concept drift and maintain performance.

❓ “How would this work in production?”

✅ Answer:

The model would score transactions in real time.
High-risk transactions could be blocked or sent for manual review.
In production, the model would score each transaction in real time by assigning a fraud probability.
Based on predefined thresholds, high-risk transactions could be automatically blocked, while medium-risk transactions could be sent for manual review to balance fraud prevention and customer experience.
Probability < 0.30 then	Allow when 0.30–0.70 then Manual review when > 0.70 then Block

12)in roc_auc_score(y_test,y_prob) why we are using y_prob not y_pred?
Answer:
ROC-AUC checks whether the model generally gives higher risk scores to churn customers than non-churn customers, no matter which cutoff we choose.
ROC-AUC measures how well the model separates the two classes by ranking predictions.
It evaluates whether positive cases receive higher probability scores than negative cases across all possible thresholds.
Therefore, it must use predicted probabilities instead of final class labels.

	
13)in churn classification we are using roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred),y we are using that?
Answer:
Initially, ROC-AUC was computed using predicted labels, which approximates performance at a single threshold.
Later, I corrected it to use predicted probabilities, since true ROC-AUC measures ranking performance across all thresholds.
